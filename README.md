# Good News, Everyone! Futurama Quotes in Your Shell

[Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/) used to have X-Bender and X-Fry, HTTP
headers that would provide a Bender or Fry quote. I added a small line
to my `~/.profile` that would grab one of these each time a new shell
was opened. Eventually Slashdot stopped adding these (probably from
seeing the load generated by folks like me that wanted their daily
Futuruma quote). These silly Futuruma quotes would bring me joy during
stressful debugging problems or hectic workdays, so I wanted them
back. Here's a Github repository that does the same thing.

## Installation
### Automatic

On Linux and OS X, with bash or zsh, you should be able to run the script `install.sh` that performs the manual instructions below.

### Manual
Rather than tax Github's servers with Bender and Fry quotes, create a
local database with the following:

	curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vsbuffalo/good-news-everyone/master/futurama.txt |\ awk '{print $0} END{print "total quotes: "NR > "/dev/stderr"}' > ~/.futurama


This creates `~/.futurama`, a text database of quotes. Then, just
add the following to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.profile`:

    # dose of Futurama
    gshuf -n1 ~/.futurama
	
On Unix systems this is likely just `shuf`. If you're using OS X like
me, [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) has GNU coreutils, just enter: `brew
install coreutils`, which installs `gshuf`.

## Source of Quotes

The textfile of quotes is from
[Orde Saunders's](https://github.com/decadecity)
[X-Futurama-headers](https://github.com/decadecity/X-Futurama-headers)
repository and [an archive](http://kly.no/misc/slashbender.txt) of the
original X-Fry and X-Bender from Slashdot. There are some redundancies
that I may remove later. I'll take pull requests for additional
quotes.
